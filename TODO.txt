TODOs in no particular order:
- Chat tagging
    - Predefined tags to help ourselves later
    - For example: the type of scenario, "important", "irrelevant", ...
    - Not to be added through UI. If/when necessary will be added directly to the DB manually (to prevent overuse)
- Forking chats
    - Tree stucture. Each message points to its parent
    - Fork button/icon on each AI message (to create fork)
    - Arrows to switch between forks
